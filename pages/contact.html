					<p class="justify">Originaly from New York City, I am currently living with my wife and three small children in Tenza, Boyacá, Colombia. We decided to move here while our children are still small so we could spend quality time with them while they are young. The cost of living in a rural Colombian town is a fraction of what it costs to live in the States so we don't have to work a lot to live well here and spend the time we want with our children. I earn a little teaching English and my wife works remotely part time - she is a civil engineer. Our plan is to stay here until they are of school age. We'll will be heading back to the US soon. But in the mean time we are getting to be with our kids and enjoy this special time in their lives. My contact info here is as follows:<p>

					<p class="contactinfo">Phone: +57 (321) 926-1600<br />
					Whatsapp<br />
					Skype: darenjm444<br />
					Email: darenjm@gmail.com</p>

					<p class="justify">There is no postal service here in Colombia like in the US. People go to the bank to pay bills or transfer money from one account to another. Fed Ex and DHL operate here too along with 3 or 4 Colombian companies that will deliver packages. Our address here is Guaya Quira, Tenza, Boyacá, Colombia, but we wouldn't get a letter if some one droped it in the mail. Just doesn't work that way. Now you know why you see people loaded up with bags and boxes at the airport. Everytime some one comes to visit form the US they come with 6 bags and return with only one.</p>
